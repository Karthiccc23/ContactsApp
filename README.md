# ContactsApp

Pros: VIPER is clean architecture to make the modules loosely coupled and easy for testing. Cons: Boiler plater code which is not a big con compared to advantages this architecture does. - My opinion

Created 3 modules

Contact List Module
Contact Details Module
Contact Add or Update Module (AU)
Delegates and protocols are used to transfer data between view controllers

Unit and UI Test cases are implemented using XCT.

No third party frameworks used in the application.
