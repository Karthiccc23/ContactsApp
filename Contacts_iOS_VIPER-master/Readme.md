# Language - Swift 5

# Architecture - VIPER 

Pros:
      VIPER is clean architecture to make the modules loosely coupled and easy for testing.
Cons:
      Boiler plater code which is not a big con compared to advantages this architecture does. - My opinion
      
Created 3 modules 
  1) Contact List Module
  2) Contact Details Module
  3) Contact Add or Update Module (AU)
  
  Delegates and protocols are used to transfer data between view controllers
  
  Unit and UI Test cases are implemented using XCT.
  
  # No third party frameworks used in the application.
